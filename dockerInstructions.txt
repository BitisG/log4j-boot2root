To compile the project yourself,compile the project into a jar in intellij with the command: 
./mvnw package; java -jar target/log4j-boot2root-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

or in the commandline if you choose to do so, by running the command:

mvn clean package

Otherwise we provide a jar that you can run without compiling anything.

You need to build the docker image. We have already provided a dockerfile, so you need to run the commands:
docker-compose build
docker-compose up

This will launch the application and the database in two different docker containers

You can view the application by entering localhost:8080 in the searchbar of your search engine.
